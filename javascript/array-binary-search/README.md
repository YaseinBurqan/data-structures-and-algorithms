# Binary Search of Sorted Array
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
## Feature Tasks

    Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

    I used loop approach (while), but in this logic there is no need to loop through all array's elements and because the array is sorted this helped with my logic. So there was O(log(n)) as time complexity and O(1) as space complexity.
